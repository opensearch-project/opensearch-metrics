## OpenSearch Metrics

The OpenSearch Metrics project showcases and keeps track of several important OpenSearch health metrics, with the goal of presenting a comprehensive overview of the OpenSearch project's health and status to the community through visualizations. The OpenSearch Metrics dashboard is accessible at [URL](https://metrics.opensearch.org/_dashboards/app/dashboards#/list?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-4y,to:now))).

### Monitoring the OpenSearch GitHub Critical Workflows

This project automates the monitoring and alerting of critical workflows within the OpenSearch GitHub project. The monitoring process is handled through a GitHub automation app that captures workflow-specific events and integrates with AWS CloudWatch and OpenSearch metrics environment.

#### Key Components:

##### GitHub Automation App
The [OpenSearch automation app](https://github.com/opensearch-project/automation-app/) is deployed to collect workflow events from GitHub. It monitors key workflows defined in the configuration file [github-workflow-runs-monitor.yml](https://github.com/opensearch-project/automation-app/blob/main/configs/operations/github-workflow-runs-monitor.yml).

##### CloudWatch Alarms
The infrastructure code for the metrics repository includes alarms created for each critical workflow. If a workflow fails, an alarm is triggered, which is used for further investigation. The alarm setup is crucial for catching failures early and ensuring quick resolution.

##### Workflow Failure Detection
The logic for detecting workflow failures is found in the [github-workflow-runs-monitor.ts](https://github.com/opensearch-project/automation-app/blob/main/src/call/github-workflow-runs-monitor.ts). When a failure is identified, the app updates the CloudWatch alarm status. Simultaneously, it indexes detailed workflow run data into the metrics cluster. This data helps in debugging failed workflows, analyzing trends, and gathering insights on previous runs. This monitoring and alerting system ensures that any issues in critical workflows are detected and reported, minimizing downtime.
